# DNA-GCcontent-python-
A script you can use to count nucleacids, calculate GC content percentages and ATGC ratios

When looking at DNA sequencing, there are a few metrics that can quickly tell you important information about the genetic sample. 
Two are the GC content and the ATGC ratio of the nucleotides. 

**GC CONTENT**
GC Content refers to the percentage of nitrogenous bases in a DNA or RNA molecule that are either guanine (G) or cytosine (C), out of the total number of bases. This metric is useful to know for a few reasons.

For instance, GC pairs are generally stronger bonds than AT bonds, meaning that a sample high in GC content is likely to be more stable, especially with regards to melting temperature. GC content is also useful for understanding other elements such as gene regulation and expression for a given sample. 

**ATGC Ratios**
The ATGC ratio is the relative proportion of adenine (A) and thymine (T) compared to guanine (G) and cytosine (C) in a sample. This ratio can share insights into the characteristics of a genetic sample. As mentioned earlier, GC content is an indicator of stability, meaning that a lower ratio of AT to GC could indicate greater stability for the molecule. ATGC rations can also explain gene expression levels, as regions with a significant discrepancy between the amount of GC to AT content, could be used for different processes. 

In order to use this Python script, you will need to have a file on hand that contains the nucleotide listings of a sequenced gene.
